								I am currently working on a range of projects to investigate how feedback impacts molecular gas. To do this, I am characterising molecular gas from 0.01 pc scales to 100 pc scale by studying individual case studies and larges statistical samples of molecular clouds, and molecular gas impacted by feedback.
							</p>
							<p>
On the smallest scales (0.01-0.04 pc), I am using a 168 pointing 3mm ALMA mosaic of a nearby star forming ridge (G316.75) along with a 192 MUSE mosaic to investigate the kinematic evolution of the molecular gas, and how the ionised gas helps shape this evolution.
							 </p>
							 <p>
I have also investigated G316.75 using Herschel and molecular line tracers at 0.1-0.7 pc scales. Using radio data, I estimate there are 2-4 O-stars are present which are up to 2 Myr old. Despite this, the virial ratio of the molecular gas indicates that the ionising and radiative feedback currently present is unable to halt the current star formation; the molecular gas densities shield the gas and allow it to continue forming stars.
							</p>
							<p>
Still in the Milky Way, I have been using Herschel Hi-gal data and Spitzer data to characterise molecular cloud evolution and correlate changes in evolution with cloud properties, environment, and neighbouring HII regions. Understanding the cloud lifecycle and their evolution, linked to environment and feedback features will help quantify how feedback impacts molecular clouds
							</p>
							<p>
I am also involved with LVM (local volume mapper), an optical IFU survey of the southern Milky Way plane to characterise the ionised gas properties. I will be focusing on the HII regions, and their properties, and linking them to the neighbouring molecular clouds. I will also focus on G316.75, and the Carina nebular (which has supernovae, winds, WR and photoionisation, all in one region) to trace the extended and diverse set of feedback mechanisms present.
							</p>
							<p>
On ~10 pc in nearby galaxies, I have been tracing the bubble population (HII regions, bubbles and superbubbles) as part of the PHANGS collaboration using JWST broadband filters to begin to trace propagating star forming theories  (i.e., triggered vs relocated vs revealed star formation) and how much of the ISM is related to bubbles. My initial study first discussed the statistics of these bubbles to determine how the environment influences the shape and number of bubbles we can see.
							</p>
							<p>
Finally using PHANGS-ALMA (and PHANGS-HST) observations at 50-150 pc scales, I have been tracing super bubbles using 12CO (2-1), a molecular gas tracer and using the kinematics to quantify the age and stellar mass powering the superbubbles. Molecular gas is fragile in the presence of ionising radiation (which superbubbles have in abundance), therefore if we see superbubbles in CO, it is young, and so we are tracing the immediate impact of feedback on the star forming gas itself. By measuring the mass of the shells vs. the stellar mass present, I was able to determine molecular gas is swept-up as the superbubble expands
							</p>
							<p>
All of my work together indicates that when dense gas forms, feedback cannot destroy the molecular gas. On small scales, we see stars continue to form, and on the scales of superbubbles, I see that the gas is pushed into shell (when dense), where it can continue to form more stars.<b>Project II Title</b><br>Project description, including further links to posters, talks, publications.
